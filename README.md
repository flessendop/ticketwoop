This tool is made to get your tickets faster then other people because **you** are way more important then other people who are looking for tickets just as hard as you.

## Setup

Spin up `npm install`

Set your config file `cypress.json`

```
{
  "projectId": "7mk3we",
  "chromeWebSecurity": false,
  "env": {
    "fuckID": "", // String that contains the ticketswap ID to get your tickets
    "myCookieString": "" // The string containing all your cookies while logged in
  }
}
```

Final run `npx open cypress`
